# Connect 4 Game

As part of my Python programming practice, I developed a Connect 4 game that allows two players to compete in a classic turn-based strategy challenge. The program features a dynamic game board, robust input handling, and checks for all win and tie conditions. The game uses object-oriented design with separate classes for `Player`, `Board`, and the main game logic, making it easy to read and maintain. This project highlights my ability to implement interactive games, manage state, and apply control flow and data structures in Python.

## Features
- Two-player Connect 4 gameplay (Player X vs Player Y)
- Dynamic 6x7 game board display
- Valid move checking and error feedback
- Win detection for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal connections
- Tie detection when the board is full
- Turn switching and continuous play until win or tie
- Object-oriented structure for clarity and modularity

## Skills Demonstrated
- Object-oriented programming (classes for game elements)
- Data structure usage (2D lists for the board)
- Control flow and loop management
- User input handling and validation
- Game state management and logic implementation

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the Connect 4 game:
3. Players take turns entering a column number (0â€“6) to drop their disc.
4. The game will display the board after each move and announce a winner or tie when the game ends.

**Example:**
```
